### Overview  
This project explores the feasibility of using Tesla's photovoltaic (PV) solar panels and Powerwall battery storage to fully power a 5,000-square-foot house in Waialae-Iki, Oahu. The study aims to determine the power requirements, design specifications, and cost considerations necessary for a home to rely solely on solar energy.

### Design Specifications  
The house is located in a residential area of Oahu, receiving ample sunlight with minor obstructions from nearby buildings and trees. Using Tesla’s solar calculator, the estimated annual energy consumption is **16,927 kWh**, requiring a **14.58 kW PV system** with solar panels, an inverter, and an energy gateway. Excess energy can be stored in Tesla Powerwall batteries to ensure continuous supply and reduce reliance on the grid.

### System Components  
The proposed system includes:  
- **Solar Panels**: Tesla panels, rated for temperatures between -40°F to 185°F, with dimensions of **74.4" × 41.2" × 1.57"**. These panels come with a **25-year warranty**.  
- **Inverter & Gateway**: The Tesla inverter (dimensions **26" × 16" × 6"**) converts DC from the panels into usable AC power, while the gateway monitors energy production and usage.  
- **Powerwall Battery Storage**: Each Tesla Powerwall has a **13.5 kWh capacity**, dimensions of **43.25" × 25" × 7.6"**, and a **10-year warranty**. This allows energy storage for nighttime use or backup during power outages.  

### Project Distribution  
Each team member was responsible for specific aspects of the project:  
- **Kristian**: Capacity factor, project duration, and system design.  
- **Jamie**: Permits, tax credits, project costs, and cost per kWh.  
- **Alex**: Environmental impacts, global issues, and system efficiency.  

### Example Calculation  
Using Tesla’s solar estimator, we projected:  

<hr>

<pre>
Estimated Annual Load: 16,927 kWh  
Required Solar Capacity: 14.58 kW  
Powerwall Storage: ~13.5 kWh per unit

### Environmental Impact  
While solar energy is a sustainable solution, panel manufacturing has environmental effects, including energy-intensive production and waste disposal concerns. Additionally, large-scale solar farms may impact wildlife, such as Hawaii’s endangered bird species.
