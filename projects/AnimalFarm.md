### Overview  
**Animal Farm** is a hands-on programming project for **EE205** that introduces students to **C and C++ programming**, with a strong emphasis on **data structures, sorting algorithms, and object-oriented design**. The project consists of multiple **labs**, each building on the previous one, helping students develop strong **software engineering** skills while working in a **real-world development environment**.

Throughout the **Animal Farm** labs, students implement **linked lists, binary search trees, sorting algorithms**, and container classes. They learn how to write clean, efficient, and well-documented code using industry-standard **tools like Git, Clang, CMake, Doxygen, and CLion**. The project is designed to mimic real-world software development, requiring students to **iterate through multiple implementations**, test their code thoroughly, and refactor as needed.

### My Role in the Project  
My role in this project was to **develop and implement core data structures** for the **Animal Farm** project. Specifically, I worked on:
- **Sorting algorithms**: Implemented **Bubble Sort for singly linked lists**.
- **Binary Search Trees**: Designed and implemented helper functions for searching, inserting, and deleting nodes.
- **Container Classes**: Built and tested **Node, Container, and SinglyLinkedList** classes.

I was responsible for writing **C++ implementation files (.cpp)**, debugging code using **CLion**, and verifying correctness through **test cases in main_*.cpp files**. Additionally, I used **GitHub for version control**, ensuring my contributions were properly documented and reviewed. My work accounted for **a significant portion of the project**, particularly in the **data structures and sorting algorithms sections**.

### Lessons Learned  
Through this project, I gained valuable experience in **C++ programming, data structure implementation, and software engineering best practices**. I learned how to:
- **Implement complex data structures** efficiently and debug them using **CLion**.
- **Write modular, reusable code** following **good software engineering principles**.
- **Use Git effectively** for version control and collaboration in a team environment.
- **Utilize CMake, Doxygen, and other industry-standard tools** to streamline the development workflow.

This experience helped me develop a deeper understanding of **object-oriented programming (OOP), algorithm efficiency, and software design patterns**. By working through multiple iterations of the code, I also gained an appreciation for **code maintainability and the importance of refactoring**.

### Labs & Key Features  
The **Animal Farm** project is divided into several labs, each focusing on different programming concepts:

#### **Animal Farm 4 - Sorting**
- Implement **Bubble Sort** for **Singly Linked Lists**.
- Develop **Binary Search Trees** with **insert, delete, and search functions**.
- Work with header files and implement corresponding **.cpp files**.

#### **Animal Farm 3 - Containers**
- Create a **container infrastructure** for storing animal data.
- Implement **Node, Container, and SinglyLinkedList** classes.
- Verify functionality through **unit tests in main_*.cpp**.
