*TypeScript: a tool that adds rules and structure to JavaScript so it's easier to manage.*

## What I Think About TypeScript

So, I just started learning TypeScript, and honestly, it’s pretty cool. I’ve used JavaScript before, and while it’s fun, it can get messy fast, especially when working on bigger projects. TypeScript feels like it’s trying to fix that. It’s like JavaScript’s smarter, more organized sibling. You still get to write flexible code, but now you have these rules (like defining types) that keep you from accidentally breaking stuff.

Compared to other languages I know, like Python or a little Java, TypeScript feels like a mix of both. It’s not as strict as Java, but it makes you think more about how your code works than Python does. One thing I really liked was how it helps you catch bugs while you’re still coding instead of after you run your program. It can be annoying to set up sometimes, but once it’s running, it’s worth it.

I also learned more about ES6 features while going through this, like arrow functions and destructuring. I kind of knew about them before, but using them with TypeScript made everything click. Features like optional chaining are super handy—they make your code look cleaner, and you don’t have to write a ton of "if" statements just to avoid errors.

From a software engineering perspective, I think TypeScript is a good choice. Sure, it takes extra time to define all your types, but it saves time later because you catch mistakes early. Plus, it makes working on a team easier since everyone can understand the code better. That said, it can be frustrating when you run into libraries without proper type definitions, but I guess no language is perfect.

## My Thoughts on Athletic Software Engineering

Okay, so athletic software engineering was definitely something different. The whole idea of doing WODs  was kind of intimidating at first. It’s basically like a timed coding challenge where you have to solve a problem quickly and correctly. The pressure was real, and at first, I felt like I was going to mess up big time.

After a few practice WODs, though, I started to see how helpful they are. It’s like working out, at first, it feels terrible, but as you keep going, you get stronger. The timed aspect made me focus more and think about how to solve problems faster. It was super satisfying when I actually finished a practice WOD on time. Even when I didn’t, I still learned a lot by reviewing what I could’ve done better.

I’d say this way of learning is pretty fun overall. It’s definitely stressful, but it’s also rewarding. I think it works for me because it pushes me to improve quickly, and it’s not just about reading or watching tutorials—it’s about doing. That said, I can see how it might not work for everyone. If you get really nervous under pressure, it could feel more frustrating than helpful.

## Final Thoughts

Learning TypeScript and doing WODs taught me a lot about stepping out of my comfort zone. TypeScript helps make messy JavaScript cleaner and easier to work with, and WODs help build confidence by challenging you to code under pressure. Both can be frustrating at times, but they also help you grow as a developer.

At the end of the day, I think challenges like these are worth it. They might seem tough at first, but the skills and lessons you take away make them totally worth it.
